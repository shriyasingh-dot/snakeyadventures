## 🎮 How to Play (The Fun Part!)

The goal is pretty simple: munch on as many yummy pink squares as you can to grow your snakey friend. But be careful—the walls are super unfriendly, and your own tail can be a real troublemaker! The more you eat, the faster things get, so you'll have to be a real pro to get a high score! 👑

### My Favorite Controls

* **Arrow Keys:** This is how you tell your little snake where to go! Just point it in the right direction.
* **SPACEBAR:** Need a breather? Just hit this to pause. It's perfect for when you need to answer a text or grab a drink.
* **R:** Oops, did you run into a wall? It happens to the best of us! Just hit 'R' to restart in a flash.

## ✨ Why You'll Love Snakey Adventures

* **It's all pink!** Seriously, I used the prettiest shades of pink I could find. It makes everything feel a little happier. 
* **Plays on your phone!** I made sure you can play this game anywhere. It has easy-to-use buttons for when you're on the go.
* **It remembers you!** It saves your high score, so you can always come back and try to beat your own record.
* **Get faster, get better!** I added a little something extra: the game speeds up the better you do, so it's always a challenge.
* **Your very own settings:** You can pick your game speed and even turn on a cool grid. Customize away!

## 📝 The boring (but important) stuff

I built this with some cool tech, and if you're a developer, you might want to know about it. It's all open-source, so feel free to peek behind the curtain! 😉

* **HTML5:** The main building blocks.
* **CSS3:** All the beautiful pink colors and styling!
* **JavaScript (ES6):** The magic that makes the snake move and the game work.
